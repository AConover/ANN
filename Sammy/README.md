# Sammy's Hyperparameter-Tuning Demo of Method 2 with Rivanna

# Introduction
My current task is the implementation of a full hyperparameter search using Rivanna. 


# Rivanna Setup Walkthrough Instructions




# Current Hyperparameter 


## Remainning Tasks:
 1. Modify the code to allow for hyperparameter-tuning by adjusting the number of hidden layers
 2. Modify the code to allow for hyperparameter-tuning by adjusting the number of dropout layers
 3. Modify the code to allow for hyperparameter-tuning by adjusting the number of dropout layers
 4. Modify the code to allow for hyperparameter-tuning by adjusting the number of hidden layers and nodes per dropout layer (changing shape in a grid search fashion)
 5. Implement the consistent global-fitting schema provided by Nathan
 6. Add in functionality that stores searched hyperparameter results according the the schema
 7. Have a functionality that prevents duplicate
